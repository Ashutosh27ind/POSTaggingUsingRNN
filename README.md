# POSTaggingUsingRNN
Use RNNs to tag words in an English corpus with their part-of-speech (POS) tag.

The process of classifying words into their parts of speech and labeling them accordingly is known as part-of-speech tagging, or simply POS-tagging.  

The NLTK library has a number of corpora which contains word and its POS tag.
